The Beginning As Data Engineers at the biggest online grocery company in India, one of our major challenges is to democratize data across the organization. But, when we began evaluating how well we were doing on this goal, we realized that frequent errors in our data pipelines had caused our business teams to lose confidence in data.

      <description>Hi! I thrive to build awesome data tools and products.
I have a diverse experience in building data tools(around 4-5 yrs) and some backend developement. Currently, I work as a Lead Engineer in Data Platforms at Blinkit (formerly Grofers) with an awesome team of developers. I have delivered several significant projects around building a unified data lake, creating real time/stream processing systems and further contributing to democratize data access in organization.</description>
