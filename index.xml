The Beginning As Data Engineers at the biggest online grocery company in India, one of our major challenges is to democratize data across the organization. But, when we began evaluating how well we were doing on this goal, we realized that frequent errors in our data pipelines had caused our business teams to lose confidence in data.

      <description>Hi! I thrive to build awesome data tools and products.
I have a diverse experience in building data tools(around 4-5 yrs) and some backend developement. Currently, I work as a Senior Software Eng.(Data) at Grofers with an awesome team of developers, here we are working on creating a unified data lake and democratize data access in organization. My work regularly piques me towards distributed systems, data intensive applications, data streams, CRDT based applications and sometimes I leisurely do some FP.</description>
